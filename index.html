<p>Twitter-Feed : Takes twitter RSS feed, strips the &quot;username: &quot;, removes 
@replies <br>
<br>
I have an RSS feed of a Twitter page on my website but I don't want the username 
of that Twitter's profile to be mentioned at the start of every message.<br>
<br>
Currently the format is, &quot;username: Twitter message&quot;, I want that simply changed 
to &quot;Twitter message&quot;.<br>
<br>
The code for the RSS is below, it would be greatly appreciated if anyone can 
think up some code that would eliminate the name from the messages. </p>
